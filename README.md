# Jewellary Management

This is a management system in which you can record stocks, sales and billing of customer in a jewellary. You can also use this in other stores by simply changing the jewellary attributes to yours specific items. The password asking on runtime is "password" itself, you can change it in the code.

There is a source code provided here named "jewel.c", you can compile it in "Dev C++, Code-Blocks", DON'T use outdated versions of C++ or you may encounter with some error. Recommended compiler : Dev C++

Or you may directly run the ".exe" executable file.

Support me for the efficiency of the code.
Thanking You.
Good Bye.
